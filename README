 System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------
XMPP4R

sqlite3-ruby
http://rubyforge.org/projects/sqlite-ruby/

GNU screen (not required, but recommended)
http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/

------------------------------------------------------
 Installation and Launching
------------------------------------------------------

Untar the distribution tarball.  Edit bridge.conf and
change the account details to those which will be used by
your bot.  Be sure to change the default bot master to
a Jabber account that you own.

Rename bridge.conf and bridge-trivia.db to 
mybotname.conf and mybotname-trivia.db where 
"mybotname" is the name of your bot as defined in 
bridge.conf.

If you have GNU screen you can launch the bot by doing:
$ ./start mybotname
This will launch your bot in a screen session which
will be detached and backgrounded. Any output will
be displayed to the screen session.

If you don't have GNU screen you can launch it this way:
$ ./xmppbridge.rb mybotname
This will launch your bot and any output will be displayed
to the console.

There probably won't be any output unless you modify the
script and set "debug_mode = true".

You should then be able to add the bot's Jabber ID (JID) to
the contact list of the default bot master JID that you
specified in the config file.  The bot will auto-accept
subscription requests.  Once added to your contact list
send the bot a message with !help as the body and it will
respond with the list of valid commands.
